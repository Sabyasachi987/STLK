## 📁 Project Structure

All internal objects are stored in the `.stlk` directory, similar to Git’s `.git` folder:

```perl
.stlk/
├── objects/
├── refs/
├── HEAD
└── index
```

## 📚 Learning Purpose

This tool is built to understand how Git works under the hood — exploring blobs, trees, commits, and branching without the full complexity of Git internals.
